# Course Context

This repository is the starter project for the SITCON Camp 2026 software engineering workshop day.

## Course theme

**災害資訊積木：從混亂需求到可交接的前端元件**

Students build a front-end-only prototype that demonstrates how disaster information can move from messy, uncertain reports into structured, reviewable, handoff-friendly components.

The learning goal is not to ship a real disaster response system. The learning goal is to experience how software engineering practices make AI-assisted and team-based development more stable.

## Fixed decisions

Do not change these without asking the course designer.

- Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Node 24 + pnpm.
- Runtime: front-end only.
- No backend service.
- No database.
- No real LLM runtime API call.
- No API keys or secrets.
- No real personal data.
- No real disaster case data.
- No Tailwind / shadcn unless explicitly requested.
- No real map dependency as a core dependency unless explicitly requested.
- Code license: MIT.
- Curriculum and documents: CC BY-SA.
- Mock data: CC0.
- Repository and demo are expected to be public.

## Repository strategy

Starter repository:

```text
sitcon-tw/camp2026-se-disaster-starter
```

Team repositories are created under:

```text
SITCON-Camp-2026
```

The repository creation and fork/template workflow has already been tested by the organizers in other course repositories. Coding agents should not redesign that strategy.

This starter repository must not contain:

- team-specific briefs
- hidden event data
- mentor guides
- expected answers
- the full source PDF report

Timed materials such as family briefs, event injection, hidden fixtures, and handoff challenges belong in a private staff repository and should be released to team repositories at the correct time.

## Course flow

48 students are split into 9 teams. Teams 1, 5, and 9 have 6 students. The rest have 5 students.

Day schedule:

| Time        | Phase                 | Purpose                                                              |
| ----------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 09:00-09:20 | Opening               | Context, constraints, safety boundary                                |
| 09:20-10:10 | Shared messy sprint   | All teams face the same messy data first                             |
| 10:10-10:30 | Debrief               | Students surface confusion about roles, states, source quality       |
| 10:30-10:50 | Case reveal           | Introduce real-world tradeoffs from disaster collaboration platforms |
| 10:50-11:10 | Split into task lines | Information intake / credibility / action                            |
| 11:10-12:00 | SDD-lite + schema     | Write spec, I/O contract, and data contract                          |

| 15:35-16:20 | Event injection       | Timed PR introduces dirty incoming data and schema mismatch          |
| 16:20-17:20 | Build Sprint 2        | Absorb change, add adapter/test/docs                                 |
| 18:20-18:40 | Handoff prep          | Prepare README/data contract/handoff notes                           |
| 18:40-19:25 | Handoff challenge     | Another team attempts to understand and modify the project           |
| 20:00-21:00 | Showcase              | Non-ranking engineering feedback                                     |

Team-specific task briefs are released later by staff and should not be preloaded into this starter repository.

## Task lines

### Line A: Information intake

How messy information enters the system.

Core model: `Report`.

Focus areas:

- Requests from affected people.
- Proxy input by field volunteers.
- Social post import.
- Duplicate, wrong, or uncertain reports.
- AI-assisted but human-decided review.

### Line B: Information credibility

How entered information is understood and trusted.

Core models: `Site`, `SiteStatusReport`.

Focus areas:

- Site list and status display.
- Suggested site update.
- Stale, conflicting, or uncertain information.
- A single report must not silently override official or verified state.

### Line C: Information to action

How trustworthy information becomes volunteer action.

Core models: `Task`, `Assignment`.

Focus areas:

- Self-claim.
- Coordinator assignment.
- Hybrid self-claim and assignment.
- Capacity, skill mismatch, locked/high-risk tasks.
- Action log and status machine.

## Data rules

Use these folder meanings consistently:

```text
src/fixtures/phase-0/
  Initial messy data used by all teams in the first sprint.

src/fixtures/shared/
  Normalized starter data. Must pass validation.

src/fixtures/released/
  Normalized data released during class by staff PRs.

src/fixtures/workspace/
  Team-produced normalized data. Should pass validation.

events/
  External dirty event input. Does not need to pass validation directly.
```

Teaching point:

- `events/**` is external dirty input.
- `src/fixtures/**` is internal normalized data.
- Team-produced normalized data should go under `src/fixtures/workspace/`.
- Demonstrable results must be visible from the Vite app entry path: `src/main.tsx` → `src/app/App.tsx`.
- Do not make the core model chase every external format.
- Prefer adapter functions for dirty incoming data.
- Extend family schemas only when the internal domain semantics are truly missing.

## Event injection design

At 15:35, staff sends one PR to each team repository.

Each PR only adds:

```text
events/event-1535/
  README.md
  incoming-data.json
  task.md
  notes-for-review.md
```

Rules:

- The PR should not modify student code.
- Incoming data may be invalid or inconsistent.
- Teams must decide whether to write an adapter, extend a family schema, mark as `needs_review`, or reject the data.
- Teams must update `docs/decisions.md`.
- Teams should update `docs/data-contract.md` if they change schema or add adapters.
- Teams should add at least one test or validation.
- Teams must not silently display uncertain data as confirmed fact.

## Coding agent rules

Good uses of AI coding agents:

- Generate components from a spec.
- Write Zod validation.
- Write tests from acceptance criteria.
- Write adapters for event input.
- Check missing empty/error/uncertain states.
- Improve README and handoff notes.
- Update `docs/ai-log.md` when AI assistance affects requirements, schema, code, tests, event handling, or handoff.
- Ensure front-end deliverables are connected to `src/app/App.tsx` so they appear in the GitHub Pages demo.

Disallowed decisions for AI agents:

- Decide which disaster information is true.
- Decide rescue or volunteer priority.
- Automatically merge suspected duplicate cases.
- Override official or verified site state from one report.
- Publish announcements.
- Display uncertain information as confirmed fact.

Before asking a coding agent to implement a feature, provide:

1. Relevant `docs/spec.md` section.
2. Acceptance criteria.
3. Relevant schema.
4. Constraints.
5. Files that may be modified.

## Task navigation layer

The starter must guide students through each phase of the day.

- Generic phase task cards live in `docs/tasks/`.
- Copyable coding-agent prompts live in `docs/prompts/`.
- Output path and GitHub Pages demo rules live in `docs/output-paths.md`.
- Team-specific brief and hidden event data do not live in the starter.
- Active classroom tasks may also be delivered through GitHub Issues generated from the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## GitHub Pages deliverable rule

The project is built and deployed as a GitHub Pages site. Student deliverables must be visible or operable from the deployed home page.

Main app path:

```text
src/main.tsx
src/app/App.tsx
```

A component, fixture, adapter, or feature is not a front-end deliverable until it is used by `src/app/App.tsx` or by a component imported from `App.tsx`.

Docs, tests, and event files support the engineering process, but they do not replace the deployed demo.

## Acceptance for starter repo

The starter repo is acceptable when:

- `pnpm install` succeeds.
- `pnpm run check` succeeds.
- It has schema contracts for common/report/site/task/assignment.
- It has fixture validation.
- It has phase-0 messy data.
- It has shared normalized data.
- It has at least one adapter example.
- It has minimal UI for records, source, status, and update time.
- It has task cards and prompt templates for each course phase.
- It has docs templates.
- It has `docs/ai-log.md` so teams can record AI-assisted work and human judgment.
- It has AGENTS, SAFETY, DATA_SOURCES, README, TEAM.
- It has GitHub Actions CI and Pages workflow.
- It contains no hidden event data.
- It contains no real personal data, secrets, or real LLM runtime calls.
